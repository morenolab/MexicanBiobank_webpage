	<h2>Data Availability</h2>

	<p>The genetic data generated and analyzed by the Mexican Biobank (MXB) Project are available through the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under the study number <strong><a href="https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001005797" target="_blank">EGAS00001005797</a>.</strong></p>
	
	<p>Access to the dataset is controlled in order to protect participant privacy and comply with ethical and legal requirements. Researchers interested in using the data should submit a data access request via the EGA platform, which will be evaluated by the Mexican Biobank Data Access Committee. Approved users will receive authorization to download the data for research purposes consistent with the original informed consent.</p>

	<h2>MexVar</h2>

	<p>The analyses of the MXB data revealed complex patterns of genetic variation across Mexico which are shaped by the diverse backgrounds of the population. This highlights the importance of a case-by-case exploration of each clinically, and biomedically, relevant genetic variants (SNVs). We believe that doing so will allow us to reach a better understanding of the highly admixed Mexican population.</p>
	
	<p>That is why we created MexVar, an interactive platform that allows users to explore SNVs annotated with GWASCatalog, ClinVar, PharmGKB, and OMIM in a semi-automated way. Powered by MXB data, MexVar providees a new way to visualize allele frequency data and corralate it to geography and/or ancestry (global and local) variables.</p>
