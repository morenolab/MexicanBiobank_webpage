        <p>The Mexican Biobank is a landmark initiative to understand the genetic diversity of the Mexican population and its impact on health and human evolution. By analyzing more than 6,000 individuals from diverse regions and ethnic backgrounds, the project is building one of the most comprehensive genomic resources ever created in Latin America. Developed entirely in Mexico, it aims to advance biomedical research, guide public health policy, and contribute to a more inclusive global view of human genetics.</p>
